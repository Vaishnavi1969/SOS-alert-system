# SOS Alert System using GPS and GSM

This project is a simple and cost-effective SOS alert system designed to send emergency location details via SMS using GPS and GSM modules. It aims to provide a basic safety mechanism, especially for women, children, and senior citizens, in critical situations.

- Vaishnavi S M
- Lakshanaa A 


##  Technologies & Components Used

- **Arduino UNO**
- **SIM800L GSM Module**
- **GPS Module (NEO-6M or similar)**
- **Lithium Battery**
- **SoftwareSerial Library**
- **Arduino IDE**

## ðŸ›  Working Principle

When the system is powered and activated, the GPS module fetches the current location coordinates (latitude and longitude). The GSM module then sends this information as an SMS to a predefined emergency contact number. An LED indicator is used to confirm that the message has been sent.
